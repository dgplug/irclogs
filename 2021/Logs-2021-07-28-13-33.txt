[13:35] <sayan> Today's class will be light and mostly self-driven, fhackdroid will be taking a Python class tomorrow. 
[13:36] <ishivamsoni> Shivam Soni
[13:38] <sayan> So today I would like folks to go through https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[13:39] <sayan> and solve the problems. The questions would be asked here and answered by the participants
[14:05] <sayan> what are you folks working on?
[14:06] <sayan> any interesting question you are working on?
[14:07] <raghavxk> i am fiddling around with  tuple unpacking and packing 
[14:08] <sayan> raghavxk: would you like to explain after you have learnt?
[14:10] <N4G4R41> me doing with varaiables and data types
[14:10] <raghavxk> coming from c++ I was confused with how can swap work without an extra variable . Then learnt how we are doing so in python by using tuple to unpack and pack variables.
[14:12] <sayan> raghavxk: good. you know this was something I asked in interviews.
[14:12] <sayan> everyone in Python world knows swap. not all know that it is tuple unpacking happening.
[14:13] <raghavxk> woah!
[14:15] <sayan> what about others?
[14:15] <Vinay> Variables and data types
[14:15] <peanutduck> looping
[14:18] <raghavxk> !
[14:19] <ishivamsoni> looping
[14:22] <ravish0007> rollcall:Ravish Shankar
[14:22] <humachine> if-else
[14:24] <ravish0007> I'm around Exceptions
[14:32] <raghavxk> can anyone explain the use of {d:%A} in f-string concept ?
[14:33] <raghavxk> >>> d = datetime.date(2004, 9, 8)
[14:33] <raghavxk> >>> f"{d} was a {d:%A}, we started the mailing list back then."
[14:33] <raghavxk> '2004-09-08 was a Wednesday, we started the mailing list back then.'
[14:37] <ravish0007> generally, it used to be 
[14:37] <ravish0007> "{0} was a {1}, we started the mailing list back then".format('2004-09-08', 'Wednesday')
[14:37] <ravish0007> This made sense to replace variables in place
[14:37] <ravish0007> f"{some_random_variable}  was a { some_random_variable: formatter}"
[14:41] <raghavxk> is %A something related to strings or datetime module of python?
[14:44] <ravish0007> datetime module
[14:45] <raghavxk> ravish0007: thank you!
[14:52] <sayan> I will leave, do I keep the class open. I really want folks to interact and learn. Remember the motto to learn and teach others.
[14:53] <sayan> That is what we are doing
[14:53] <sayan> Folks who cannot stay long, fhackdroid will take class tomorrow.
[14:53] <sayan> I will keep the class open for next 2-3 hours.
[14:53] <sayan> Ask questions, and try to understand together.
[14:55] <ravish0007> jasonbraganza: I wish I had enough guts to do that.
[15:05] <peanutduck> the string lstrip why the need for "cwsd." when "w." is enough?
[15:12] <peanutduck> https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strings.html#strip-the-strings
[15:19] <raghavxk> maybe it is there to make the idea clear that all substrings permutation will be removed .
[15:26] <peanutduck> Thank you raghavxk 
[15:30] <ravish0007> I was about to say that but just learnt "permutation" fits very well, thanks raghavxk.
[15:51] <nabarun> what are the interesting things you folks are discovering while reading the book?
[15:56] <ravish0007> I like the book follows KISS principle 
[15:56] <ravish0007> s/the/how the
[16:06] <raghavxk> i discovered many things . i discovered that variables in python are pointers pointing to values stored in memory , which explaines why if we initialise a variable by a variable in python , change in value of one variable reflects in both the variables.

[18:04] <ravish0007> https://ravish0007.github.io, my blog ;)
[18:05] <avikalp> Folks, I missed the class today. Can someone please share the logs?
[18:08] <raghavxk> sure
[03:02] <peanutduck> Morning all
[03:18] <ravish0007> Morning, peanutduck
[03:23] <peanutduck> Morning ravish0007 
[03:28] <ravish0007> peanutduck: What are you working on ? 
[03:29] <peanutduck> Was planning to finish up the pym book today ravish0007 
[03:31] <ravish0007> Cool ! I'll do the same then.
[04:30] <jasonbraganza> good morning folks! :)
[04:37] <sayan> Nice! I thought I'll end the class at 10:30 but then I fell asleep!
