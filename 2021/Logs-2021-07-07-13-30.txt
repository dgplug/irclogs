[13:34] <nabarun> Please use !
[13:36] <nabarun> Since no one has any doubts, does someone want to summarize what they learnt from the homework?
[13:37] <ishivamsoni> After watching the movies I understood why inclusion is important in Technology.
[13:37] <nabarun> ravish0007, vinay ?
[13:37] <ravish0007> nabarun: a moment please
[13:39] <ravish0007> I understood why diversity is so important and how bias can slide on it own and how it can impact vast amount of people in a bad way
[13:39] <nabarun> Thanks for sharing your views ishivamsoni ravish0007 
[13:39] <nabarun> let's continue towards today's session.
[13:40] <nabarun> I will be talking about Linux and introduce you to some basic shell commands.
[13:40] <nabarun> How many of you know about Linux and have used it?
[13:40] <nabarun> Please respond with yes/no
[13:40] <ravish0007> yes
[13:41] <vipulk1> Yes.
[13:41] <raghavxk> yes

[13:41] <vinay> yes
[13:41] <peanutduck> Yes
[13:41] <ritik> Yes.but not much 
[13:41] <humachine1> yes
[13:42] <nabarun> avikalp, vipulk1, VKSusheel, ravish0007 ?
[13:42] <nabarun> Folks, you need to be interactive during the classes. Otherwise, you wouldn't get value out of the sessions.
[13:43] <ravish0007> nabarun: I'm fluent in command line and basic system administration
[13:43] <avikalp> yes
[13:43] <nabarun> Awesome. Thanks everyone. I'm assuming others present didn't.
[13:43] <nabarun> Linux is a family of open source operating systems.
[13:43] <nabarun> It was introduced by Linus Torvalds around 28 years ago.
[13:44] <ravish0007> !
[13:44] <nabarun> Popular examples of Linux operating systems include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux and the list goes on.
[13:44] <nabarun> Can you all read this article https://opensource.com/resources/linux ?
[13:44] <nabarun> Please type done when finished. It shouldn't take much time.
[13:44] <nabarun> next
[13:45] <ravish0007> No offense, Shouldn't it be GNU/Linux instead of Linux
[13:45] <nabarun> If you have any questions from the article, please feel free to raise your hand (!).
[13:46] <schubisu> ravish0007: this will also be treated in the article
[13:47] <nabarun> So, Linux is the kernel that powers the family of open systems.
[13:47] <nabarun> The Linux kernel when built and distributed along with GNU software is referred to as GNU/Linux.
[13:48] <nabarun> There has been lot of debate around it. And, I feel we should not focus on the debate as saptaks mentioned in the previous class.
[13:48] <nabarun> We can talk about it off the class.
[13:49] <ravish0007> schubisu: okay
[13:49] <ravish0007> nabarun: understood
[13:50] <ishivamsoni> Done
[13:50] <raghavxk> done
[13:50] <humachine1> done
[13:50] <nabarun> let's give it 1 or 2 mins for folks to finish reading the article.
[13:51] <ravish0007> done
[13:52] <ritik> Done 
[13:52] <nabarun> Okay. Let's move ahead.
[13:52] <SANJAY> done
[13:52] <nabarun> Back in the days, the primary mode of interaction with Linux was through the Command Line Interface, also popularly known as the CLI.
[13:52] <nabarun> Over the years Graphical User Interfaces came into existence.
[13:53] <nabarun> Think of the command line as a Chef's Kitchen.
[13:53] <nabarun> There are a lot of tools in the kitchen.
[13:53] <nabarun> The chef uses those tools to create delicious dishes.
[13:53] <nabarun> Command line programs are also like the tools in the kitchen.
[13:54] <nabarun> They help the programmers in crafting beautiful software.
[13:54] <nabarun> Of the people who have used Linux, what commands have you used before?
[13:54] <ravish0007> htop
[13:54] <vinay> nmtui
[13:54] <peanutduck> ls
[13:55] <humachine1> free, top, ps
[13:55] <ravish0007> pacman ;)
[13:55] <nabarun> Amazing. I see a lot of variety.
[13:55] <nabarun> Now, I want all of you to have a look at https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/startingcommands.html and start trying the commands.
[13:55] <raghavxk> basic navigation , htop, sensors .
[13:56] <nabarun> For folks who are already familiar, they can also go through the other sections of https://lym.readthedocs.io. We will take doubts from this at the end of the class.
[13:56] <nabarun> Please raise your hand to ask any doubts with the starting commands.
[14:00] <ishivamsoni> ! 
[14:01] <nabarun> next
[14:01] <nabarun> next
[14:01] <ishivamsoni> !
[14:01] <nabarun> next
[14:01] <ishivamsoni> How rm command removes in a recursive way?
[14:02] <nabarun> ishivamsoni: did you read the section in that link? Or, do you want to know the mechanics behind it?
[14:02] <ishivamsoni> with option -r
[14:03] <ishivamsoni> I want to know the mechanics behind it and how it's different from the normal rm.
[14:05] <nabarun> I am entirely sure about the mechanics of rm -r. But what I can guess is there can be two scenarios.
[14:05] <nabarun> 1. It walks the directory that you specify and deletes all files and folders inside it.
[14:06] <nabarun> 2. It deletes the reference to the folder on disk, so that it's not visible. We will understand more about filesystems in later classes.
[14:06] <nabarun> ishivamsoni: that was a good question!
[14:07] <nabarun> We should question the internals of programs that we use.
[14:07] <ishivamsoni> okay, thanks.
[14:08] <nabarun> How far are people with the starting commands?
[14:10] <ritik> Starting commands done 
[14:11] <humachine1> yeah they are familiar except id and tree 
[14:12] <nabarun> What about others? Are you all still around?
[14:12] <vinay> done with starting commands
[14:13] <raghavxk> am done with starting commands
[14:13] <ravish0007> done
[14:14] <nabarun> No more doubts? That's nice.
[14:15] <nabarun> We are at the end of this session.
[14:15] <nabarun> The homework from this session would be to read and try the commands in:
[14:15] <nabarun> 1. https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users.html
[14:15] <nabarun> 2. https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/files.html
[14:15] <nabarun> 3. https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes.html
[14:15] <nabarun> 4. https://lym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networking.html
[14:15] <nabarun> 5. Chapter 3 of https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html#theRootFilesystem/
[14:16] <nabarun> Since the next class would be on Friday, you don't need to complete all of these by then, but we will check in with you about the progress.
[14:16] <nabarun> In the next weeks, we will have follow up sessions to resolve doubts from these and do more hands-on experiments.
[14:16] <nabarun> Do keep in mind it's best to ask away your doubts as you face them any time in the channel when a class is not happening. Don't wait for the next class.
