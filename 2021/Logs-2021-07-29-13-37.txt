[13:39] <fhackdroid> Awesome!
[13:40] <fhackdroid> So first of all folks I am sorry for the huge gap between classes.
[13:40] <fhackdroid> I have been going through some issues and if I wasted someone's time I am really sorry about it.
[13:41] <fhackdroid> Having said that :) I saw the projec ideas
[13:41] <fhackdroid> Pretty innovative.
[13:42] <fhackdroid> So the goal now is to drive those ideas to completion
[13:42] <ravish0007> Ravish Shankar
[13:42] <fhackdroid> So did anyone start implementing those ideas?
[13:42] <N4G4R41> no
[13:42] <sud0ed> yes
[13:43] <humachine> no
[13:43] <shivam> no
[13:43] <raghavxk> no
[13:43] <ravish0007> I haven't put my idea in the pad but I tried few things today
[13:43] <peanutduck> no
[13:43] <sud0ed> doing some background checking, like the api support available already
[13:45] <fhackdroid> ravish0007: https://pad.riseup.net/p/ideas-keep
[13:45] <fhackdroid> in case you want to put your idea else no issues :)
[13:46] <fhackdroid> So first thing first we need to be in implementing phase of our ideas from the begining 
[13:48] <fhackdroid> Alright so how many of you did your homework
[13:49] <shivam> i did it.
[13:49] <sud0ed> I did
[13:51] <fhackdroid> what about others?
[13:51] <N4G4R41> i didn't, but will complete within next class
[13:52] <ravish0007> homework meaning reading the pymbook ?
[13:52] <fhackdroid> ravish0007: yes
[13:52] <peanutduck> I did
[13:52] <raghavxk> i did
[13:53] <ravish0007> I'm around Exceptions, I'll complete by today for sure
[13:53] <fhackdroid> okay so let's start with questions.
[13:54] <fhackdroid> Any doubts till what you all have read?
[13:54] <sud0ed> no not yet
[13:54] <raghavxk> no
[13:54] <N4G4R41> no
[13:55] <peanutduck> no
[13:55] <fhackdroid> Cool since no one has any questions for me
[13:55] <fhackdroid> I have a lot of questions for you all :)
[13:55] <ravish0007> Hehe
[13:56] <fhackdroid> So how many of you have prior programing experience?
[13:56] <ravish0007> Me
[13:56] <raghavxk> me
[13:56] <shivam> Me
[13:56] <sud0ed> I have
[13:57] <Vinay> Me
[13:57] <ravish0007> But I always produce spaghetti 
[13:57] <N4G4R41> me a little
[13:57] <humachine> little bit scripting 
[13:57] <sud0ed> !
[13:57] <fhackdroid> next
[13:57] <sud0ed> I have a doubt can I ask
[13:57] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: yes
[13:58] <sud0ed> in amny code I saw like "if __name_-==__main__: what dose it signifies
[13:58] <sud0ed> <eof>
[14:02] <sud0ed> am I offline? or noone is typing anything?
[14:02] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: To explain this in a very normal terms since we have not develved in Python yet, if the line you saw is in a script the code written after that or in that block is executed
[14:04] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: again there is a lot of details in this but to bluntly understand that it's a main function in C if you are familar with C
[14:04] <sud0ed> ok understood
[14:04] <raghavxk> !
[14:04] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: again this is not a perfect explaination but a general structure
[14:05] <fhackdroid> next
[14:05] <raghavxk> >>> f"{d} was a {d:%A}, we started the mailing list back then."
[14:05] <raghavxk> what is use of %A in this statement?
[14:05] <raghavxk> https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variablesanddatatypes.html#formatting-strings this is from this page in bool
[14:05] <raghavxk> s/bool/book
[14:08] <fhackdroid> raghavxk: %A is a format string, now the datetime object has a lot of special format strings
[14:08] <fhackdroid> so if you format a datetime object with %A it gives you the day of the week
[14:09] <fhackdroid> raghavxk: is it clear?
[14:09] <raghavxk> got it . thanks fhackdroid
[14:10] <fhackdroid> alright any other questions
[14:10] <sud0ed> !
[14:11] <shivam> !
[14:12] <fhackdroid> next
[14:13] <sud0ed> where can anyone get that all format string list of an object
[14:15] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: you can check the library/functions documentations 
[14:16] <sud0ed> thanks fhackdroid
[14:16] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: for example for dateobject https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
[14:17] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: is that clear? 
[14:17] <fhackdroid> sud0ed: do you have any follow-ups for it?
[14:18] <sud0ed> yes thanks fhackdroid, I was checking the link
[14:18] <fhackdroid> next
[14:19] <shivam> In evaluateequ.py 
[14:19] <shivam> https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operatorsexpressions.html#evaluateequ-py
[14:19] <shivam> why 2 is used in print("%2d %6.4f" % (i , sum)) ?.
[14:20] <fhackdroid> shivam: did you see the output?
[14:24] <shivam> yes
[14:25] <fhackdroid> shivam: can you try extrapolating what might be happpening?
[14:25] <fhackdroid> s/happening/happening
[14:26] <shivam> the output was same when i replaced 2 with other numbers.
[14:30] <ravish0007> shivam:  Are you clear with .4f  ?
[14:31] <fhackdroid> shivam: what about d what do you think that is doing?
[14:33] <shivam> yes i am clear with .4f,  it sets the number of decimal places.
[14:35] <raghavxk> shivam: observe how numbering is aligned to right and spaces before them.
[14:35] <ravish0007> d is width I believe, try '%1d' % (10000) all the way upto '%10d'
[14:35] <shivam> i think d denotes the integer.  
[14:36] <shivam> okay i got it thanks.  
[14:37] <fhackdroid> shivam: try something like %80d
[14:37] <fhackdroid> and tell me what do you see
[14:39] <ravish0007> TIL: wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_format_string
[14:39] <ravish0007> Especially syntax => %[parameter][flags][width][. precision][length]type
[14:39] <ravish0007> [] are optional
[14:41] <fhackdroid> shivam: let me know what you can see
[14:41] <shivam> a lot spaces are printed before each line in the output.
[14:42] <fhackdroid> shivam: so does the number makes sense now?
[14:42] <shivam> yes it does, thanks fhackdroid & ravish0007. 
[14:42] <fhackdroid> Okay folks I am running out of time now so here is a homework
[14:44] <fhackdroid> Write a compute program to get a list of fruits from the user and just print the fruits which are starting with 'O'
[14:44] <fhackdroid> is the question clear?
[14:44] <fhackdroid> We will meet tomorrow again at 9 PM IST
[14:44] <fhackdroid> next
[14:45] <N4G4R41> yes clear, how to submit?
