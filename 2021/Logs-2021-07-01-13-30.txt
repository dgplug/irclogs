[13:53] <N4G4R41> sayan: why i can't send messgaes, it says messages can't send
[13:53] <booom> @municor has left. So I'll try to asnwer. Over quoting is ">>>>>>>"; referring a preivous response way too much.

[13:54] <mohitsood> Apologies! @sayan I haven't gone through the assignment yet. But definitely it won't happen again
[13:54] <sayan> N4G4R41: Please stop spamming the channel
[13:55] <famubu>   /whois N4G4R41 
[13:55] <N4G4R41> sorry for more messages, some problem here, now its ok
[13:55] <sayan> Those folks, who have not read the previous assignment, please read it now
[13:56] <sayan> Those who have completed reading the assignment please read this now: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:56] <N4G4R41> sayan: sorry I'm not intended to spam, at first it says messges couldn't be sent, try again many times, so it is coming as whole lot
[13:57] <sayan> the folks reading "Ask Questions the Smart Way" - please drop your questions here. 
[13:57] <sayan> Please read it now. 
[13:59] <sayan> We follow the points noted in there quite seriously so next week when we start our sessions, you need to follow the things mentioned in there.
[14:01] <sayan> This helps, the person taking the class, the other folks attending the class.
[14:01] <sayan> Not only this remember these when interacting with open source communities
[14:02] <sayan> This is training is free, but the time devoted by me and the other folks who would take the class is not.
[14:03] <booom> Got it. 
[14:03] <sayan> The training does not have any formal end, if the students of the session don't follow, or are interactive, we will stop the classes :)
[14:04] <sayan> Similarly, the maintainers you interact with, asking for help. Their time is valuable, so respect is very important.
[14:04] <sayan> asking smart questions is a way that helps.
[14:05] <sayan> How many folks here are using Matrix?
[14:05] <sayan> or platform like irccloud?
[14:05] <sayan> please write "me"
[14:05] <avikalp> me
[14:05] <municomr> me
[14:05] <iamsdas[m]> me
[14:05] <raghavxk> me
[14:05] <vipulk> me
[14:05] <N4G4R41> me
[14:07] <famubu> also using matrix.
[14:08] <sayan> Okay, if there are too many disconnections, or the bridges are giving issues, we would say to join this training via IRC client
[14:08] <sayan> this helps to bring sanity in the class
[14:10] <booom> I've joined through libera web chat. I'll try irccloud for next class.
[14:10] <sayan> for irccloud folks, please don't paste multi-line pastebin links
[14:11] <N4G4R41> ok 
[14:11] <raghavxk> I was late to class. Can anyone tell me what are we discussing today?
[14:12] <municomr> ok
[14:12] <famubu> !
[14:12] <avikalp> raghavxk: we are going through any questions that readers had from previous assignments and we got a new reading link: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:13] <sayan> if you join the class late, please discuss things in private, as a friend for logs
[14:13] <raghavxk> Thank You! This was helpful.
[14:13] <sayan> not during the class
[14:13] <sayan> sorry not in here.
[14:13] <sayan> ext
[14:13] <sayan> next
[14:13] <famubu> Doesn't the libera web chat also count as an irc client? 
[14:15] <sayan> it does!
[14:18] <avikalp> !
[14:18] <sayan> next
[14:18] <avikalp> How do we indicate here that we have read the smart questions article and have no questions regarding it?
[14:18] <famubu> !
[14:21] <sayan> avikalp: just type done reading, but you have already completed reading?
[14:22] <sayan> ext
[14:22] <sayan> next
[14:22] <avikalp> Most of it was part of the assignment, I guess. I had read from the "#forum" section and on. I have completed reading uptil that now
[14:22] <famubu> If we agree with a user's message in IRC, how do people usually 'upvote' that message? Is posting a "+1" okay? Or is such a practice considered bad?
[14:24] <sayan> famubu: bad practice at least for this channel. different channels have different way to see it
[14:24] <sayan> but in general people hate plain +1, Rather typing a line is much better
[14:26] <sayan> avikalp: you mean you did not read before #forum?
[14:26] <famubu> !
[14:27] <avikalp> yes.
[14:28] <avikalp> I had not read before the forum section before the class. I read it now.
[14:28] <sayan> next
[14:29] <famubu> Is it bad to post a message thanking the person who answered a question? Like here after getting a query answered after putting a "!"? And what if a participant has a question related to the answer that was just given? Should they put up another "!" or just reply?
[14:31] <sayan> you can write thanks, any questions should be started with !
[14:32] <sayan> or else people might just putting followup  questions
[14:33] <raghavxk> !
[14:33] <famubu> Okay, thanks. :-)
[14:33] <avikalp> !
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:34] <sayan> next
[14:35] <avikalp> Who should subscribe to the dgplug mailing list? Everyone here, who is interested in contributing to open-source projects, or just the ones who would be interested in answering questions related to open-source?
[14:35] <sayan> avikalp: everyone should subscribe to the dgplug mailing list. 
[14:35] <avikalp> Thank you
[14:35] <sayan> It's always good to read about the intro/agenda of the mailing list
[14:36] <sayan> Instead of thank you if your question is answered type <eom> = end of message
[14:36] <sayan> next
[14:39] <raghavxk> !
[14:39] <booom> Done reading. 
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:40] <sayan> booom: great!
[14:40] <raghavxk> Is it ethical to share small personal details over IRC  or to ask someone for the same?
[14:42] <sayan> raghavxk: good question. it depends on a lot of things, you might not able to say if the person you are sharing with is the person you intended.
[14:42] <sayan> there is no face to nick
[14:42] <sayan> so better to avoid. :)
[14:42] <sayan> also if you think it is okay and might not affect then you might.
[14:43] <sayan> It depends a lot on the connections you make over time.
[14:43] <sayan> There is no fixed answer
[14:44] <raghavxk> <eom>
[14:45] <sayan> I don't ask for personal details :)
[14:46] <raghavxk> I get the idea.
[14:48] <sayan> next
[14:48] <sayan> what the status of reading folks?
[14:48] <sayan> How far are you folks?
[14:48] <iamsdas[m]> Done reading
[14:48] <raghavxk> I am done reading.
[14:48] <N4G4R41> completed halfway
[14:52] <avikalp> !
[14:58] <sayan> next
[14:58] <avikalp> Sorry, I was able to resolve my own doubt through web search. <eom>>
[14:59] <sayan> avikalp: great!
[14:59] <sayan> putting the document to test! but you should have searched first
[14:59] <avikalp> I agree. I realised after sending the "!"
[14:59] <sayan> Let's end the class here. Next class we will start with Linux commands. Please read this again if you need to, and the previous assignment.
