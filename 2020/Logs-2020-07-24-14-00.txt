[14:02] <sayan> How are you folks doing?
[14:02] <stalwartcoder> I am doing good sayan.
[14:02] <stalwartcoder> Feeling tired from last 2 days
[14:02] <stalwartcoder> What about you?
[14:02] <Anjika> sayan: Doing good
[14:02] <sayan> I want to get a feedback of the sessions we had till now. Please go ahead and raise your hands
[14:03] <sahilister[m]> Fine. Having online classes as usual.
[14:03] <stalwartcoder> !
[14:03] <Anjika> but today my day was quite hectic
[14:03] <sahilister[m]> !
[14:03] <sayan> Are we going slow, fast, or we are doing okay
[14:03] <sayan> next
[14:03] <Anjika> !
[14:04] <stalwartcoder> We are doing okay. I feel I need little more time to completely the homework.
[14:04] <stalwartcoder> The sessions are going amazing.
[14:04] <daemon1024> !
[14:04] <sayan> next
[14:04] <sahilister[m]> Sessions are good as usual. Pace is fine. Got to learn about communication etiquette, philosophy and the power of cli.
[14:04] <Anjika> For me the session is going good and matches my pace also
[14:04] <sahilister[m]> and i love the homeworks.
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <Anjika> As I'm new to this so I take some time to grab everything
[14:05] <sayan> next
[14:05] <naveen_Neo> !
[14:05] <stalwartcoder> s/completely/complete
[14:05] <darshna__> !
[14:05] <sayan> stalwartcoder: sahilister[m]: Anjika thanks, I would really like to take time, rather than going fast, quality over quantity
[14:05] <Anjika> Due to homework, everything is getting more clear
[14:06] <sayan> next
[14:06] <daemon1024> Sessions are good. Assignments are great. Pace is fine. I am learning things in much deeper way than usual.
[14:07] <peanutduck> !
[14:07] <naveen_Neo> For me, learning about open source culture is a new thing, other than that till now I have not got much of a new information
[14:08] <naveen_Neo> But i'm looking forward to get more
[14:08] <sayan> I was feeling that we are going slow, but sounds like we are good.
[14:08] <sayan> naveen_Neo: sure, yes, we are still in basics, we usually move much more, but better to go at the pace of the slowest
[14:08] <sayan> naveen_Neo: in that case I can give you some extra reading material
[14:09] <naveen_Neo> sayan:sure
[14:09] <sayan> which eventually will be given to others as well
[14:09] <sayan> but you get some more
[14:09] <BhaveshSGupta> !
[14:09] <sayan> next
[14:09] <sayan> next
[14:09] <darshna__> This time things are quite clear and it' s easy to understand. Things started from scratch and it's easy and fun to read.
[14:10] <peanutduck> Sessions are making me to learn. The more I learn the more I noticed that I do not know a lot of things.
[14:12] <sayan> Another thing I was thinking that nabarun can take the Tuesday classes, and I can parallel take another type of class, i.e. computer architecture based?
[14:13] <sayan> in short two different topics a week, will you folks can handle it?
[14:13] <daemon1024> sayan I can :)
[14:13] <Anjika> Yes
[14:13] <stalwartcoder> !
[14:13] <sahilister[m]> Yes
[14:13] <sayan> I would like you folks to thinks that join these two classes
[14:14] <sayan> s/thinks/things
[14:14] <stalwartcoder> !
[14:14] <sayan> Computer science is about relating things, so if you are doing bash, then how it works on the other side.
[14:14] <sayan> next
[14:14] <sayan> next
[14:15] <stalwartcoder> Parallel you mean one on another day, right?
[14:15] <sayan> Yes, we are having two classes, two parrallel sessions
[14:15] <stalwartcoder> Okay
[14:15] <sayan> I want to know the feedback from all.
[14:15] <BhaveshSGupta> I have been taking for around three or more years, I feel we are going at slower pace. But more people are understanding.
[14:16] <sahilister[m]> Two sessions would be fine.
[14:16] <naveen_Neo> sayan: I think it's a good Idea, We would cover more things in this fashion.
[14:17] <peanutduck> Two sessions sounds awesome!!
[14:17] <darshna__> yes I can
[14:17] <sahilister[m]> * sahilister feels more exploration, more fun
[14:17] <sayan> BhaveshSGupta: right, we are slow, or else by this time we were finishing Python maybe :)
[14:18] <sayan> also who all don't have a linux machine?
[14:18] <sayan> next
[14:18] <stalwartcoder> I am using Mac machine
[14:19] <BhaveshSGupta> I have ubuntu VM on azure, But no physical machine
[14:19] <raydeeam> mac+fedora :P
[14:19] <darshna__> I am using LinuxMint
[14:19] <naveen_Neo> I'm using WSL
[14:21] <sayan> Just to add the recommended system is Fedora, because I use that and using that for 10 years now
[14:21] <sayan> easier to debug, though we have other folks who use other system to help to debug, like Arch, or Debian
[14:22] <sahilister[m]> * sahilister is on Debian
[14:22] <sayan> Okay to starting off: Go over and read this: https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/01-bootsector-barebones
[14:23] <sayan> Mac users: https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/00-environment -- may need to use this
[14:23] <Anjika> *Sorry I got disconnected
[14:23] <sayan> others: https://www.qemu.org/download/
[14:24] <sayan> also, things I will teach in next few days, is something I am reading myself and I always wanted to
[14:24] <saptaks> I can help with debugging in Debian
[14:24] <sayan> I feel that every engineer show have a knowledge of it
[14:25] <sayan> saptaks: that's why I wrote Debian and not Ubuntu :)
[14:26] <sayan> for every concept we will try to learn this year, we will try to cover the internals because that is required
[14:28] <sayan> tell when you folks are done installing
[14:29] <sahilister[m]> done
[14:30] <naveen_Neo> done
[14:30] <sayan> done installing or reading?
[14:30] <sahilister[m]> installing
[14:31] <Anjika> installing
[14:31] <stalwartcoder> Done
[14:31] <peanutduck> Done installing
[14:32] <snowmanstark> done
[14:32] <raydeeam> done
[14:33] <daemon1024> done
[14:33] <darshna__> done
[14:34] <BhaveshSGupta> done installing
[14:36] <naveen_Neo> I can't Install it, on my windows system
[14:36] <BhaveshSGupta> naveen_Neo, you can install on windows also
[14:37] <stalwartcoder> naveen_Neo: what error it's giving?
[14:37] <sayan> probably read through it today, and try setting over the weekend?
[14:37] <naveen_Neo> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk
[14:38] <sayan> No clue :)
[14:38] <stalwartcoder> Just say run anyway
[14:38] <naveen_Neo> sayan: Yeah, will do that
[14:39] <stalwartcoder> Well, I executed the bootloader ( excitement )
[14:39] <sayan> This class will be more reading than I can type it's better that you read the docs, so I created a hackmd doc which can be referenced
[14:39] <naveen_Neo> stalwartcoder: It's not giving that option, simply blocking it
[14:39] <sayan> https://hackmd.io/@93U2v-7gSsiyMySlaP70dw/life-os
[14:39] <sayan> Ask question, I can guarantee and answer but we will get to the answer together :)
[14:40] <sayan> Any questions till here?
[14:41] <stalwartcoder> naveen_Neo: oops. Then there will be another option. Sorry, couldn't help
[14:42] <daemon1024> qemu is installed for me , but can't run it using ` qemu ` or ` qemu-system-x86_64 ` . simply says command not found.
[14:42] <daemon1024> I am on Pop_OS! ( ubuntu based ) , can't seem to find qemu in ` /usr/bin ` too
[14:43] <snowmanstark> demon1024: same for me
[14:43] <sayan> same popos?
[14:43] <nabarun> stalwartcoder: small note, never do "run anyway" without understanding what you are running.
[14:43] <sayan> though raise you hands to ask questions :)
[14:44] <sahilister[m]> `qemu` command doesn't respond on Debian too.
[14:44] <sahilister[m]> s/Debian/my Debian
[14:45] <stalwartcoder> nabarun: understood.
[14:45] <stalwartcoder> I said so because we were executing the .bin file. But yeah that's a good point to keep in mind. Thanks :)
[14:45] <sayan> maybe do this: sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm qemu virt-manager virt-viewer libvirt-bin
[14:45] <sayan> this will also install the virt-manager
[14:45] <nabarun> stalwartcoder: you never know what's in the bin file.
[14:46] <naveen_Neo> !
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:48] <naveen_Neo> ohh its not related to the current topic though.. I just wanted to know nabarun just did that.. talking in 3rd person :)
[14:48] <daemon1024> sayan installing ` qemu-kvm ` did the job, it had qemu-system-x86_64 as a dependency
[14:49] <sayan> daemon1024: great!
[14:49] <sayan> I actually thought but then I just pasted the whole thing
[14:49] <snowmanstark> naveen_Neo: use `/me` before the text you type in the IRC
[14:49] <sayan> What about others?
[14:49] <sayan> snowmanstark: thanks!
[14:49] <sayan> Anjika: peanutduck darshna__: all good?
[14:50] <BhaveshSGupta> !
[14:50] <darshna__>  yeah, mine is installing
[14:50] <Anjika> Just now it got installed
[14:50] <BhaveshSGupta> I am on windows, qemu got installed
[14:50] <darshna__> still now, shows 5mins left
[14:50] <daemon1024> It booted for me ðŸ™‚
[14:50] <sahilister[m]> !
[14:50] <naveen_Neo> snowmanstark: cool. Thanks
[14:52] <sayan> next
[14:52] <sayan> next
[14:53] <peanutduck> !
[14:53] <sahilister[m]> Will we use qemu to run VMs through virt-manager?
[14:53] <sayan> Follow this if you done with the boot sector: https://hackmd.io/@93U2v-7gSsiyMySlaP70dw/life-os
[14:53] <sayan> sahilister[m]: no, terminal we will use
[14:53] <sahilister[m]> sayan: thanks!
[14:54] <sayan> next

[14:55] <sayan> peanutduck: great!
[14:56] <peanutduck> Running on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS, I just have to use qemu-system-x86_64 command instead
[14:59] <sayan> what about others?
[15:00] <sayan> :(
[15:00] <sahilister[m]> Still in trying the boot sector.
