[14:03] <sayan> Folks, questions from last class
[14:04] <sayan> nabarun had completed bits of vim class right?
[14:04] <sahilister[m]> sayan: Yes, nabarun took class on vim.
[14:04] <sayan> questions?
[14:05] <sahilister[m]> sayan: No question as of now.
[14:05] <Anjika> No
[14:05] <sayan> So, just to update I will halt the OS class for sometime. I'm not getting enough time to look into the bits myself due to the PyCon India event. Will resume it later
[14:05] <darshna__> sayan: no questions
[14:05] <sayan> Also, how many used vim?
[14:05] <sahilister[m]> !
[14:06] <sayan> or how many loved it, and how many hated it?
[14:06] <sayan> next
[14:06] <sahilister[m]> Using vim full time.
[14:06] <darshna__> !
[14:06] <sayan> next
[14:06] <sahilister[m]> Not sure loved it or not yet.
[14:07] <sayan> others
[14:07] <darshna__> I used to get confused initially but after the last class atleast I know how to start using it a bit
[14:07] <sayan> darshna__: glad to know
[14:07] <Anjika> !
[14:07] <sayan> next
[14:07] <sayan> fire up you editors!
[14:07] <Anjika> Can we store date in a variable?
[14:08] <Anjika> As I tried it in vi editor, but failed
[14:08] <sayan> Anjika: can you explain the context? which variable are you storing annd why?
[14:09] <sayan> usually variables are used for languages and not editors
[14:09] <Anjika> Just for try only, I first manipulated the date and tried to store that in a variable
[14:10] <sayan> Anjika: what error were you getting?
[14:10] <Anjika> I was not getting any error nor any output
[14:11] <sayan> Anjika: can you tell the things you did, I'm not sure if I understannd
[14:12] <sayan> vi is an editor, not a language.
[14:12] <Anjika> First I printed the date by simple date command, after that I manipulated the month of the present date by reducing it by 3 months
[14:13] <Anjika> And I tried to store the manipulated date in a variable so thatit  can be used in for loop
[14:13] <Anjika> s/thatit/that it
[14:15] <sayan> ^^ but this is not related to the editor, vim
[14:16] <Anjika> yes, I have not tried this in vim
[14:16] <sayan> no, this is not related to either vim, or vi
[14:17] <sayan> let's discuss it after class
[14:17] <sahilister[m]> *sahilister saw s/incorrect/correct in action, in vim
[14:17] <Anjika> Okay
[14:17] <sayan> for others please download this wall of text in a file, `plaintext` https://sayanchowdhury.fedorapeople.org/plaintext
[14:18] <siddharthvipul> sorry I am late, I am interested in this session
[14:18] <sayan> Today we will introduce you folks to visual mode
[14:19] <snowmanstark> Philemon Johnson
[14:20] <BhaveshSGupta> done
[14:20] <sahilister[m]> Done.
[14:20] <sayan> visual mode is used to select a chunk/or block of text.
[14:20] <apsychogirl[m]> done
[14:21] <sayan> Press `v` and then use your h,j,k,l keys
[14:21] <sayan> what do you see?
[14:21] <sahilister[m]> It's selecting/highlighting text.
[14:21] <sayan> others?
[14:21] <siddharthvipul> same here as sahilister[m]
[14:22] <apsychogirl[m]> yes
[14:22] <snowmanstark> Done
[14:22] <BhaveshSGupta> same here
[14:22] <BhaveshSGupta> it is selecting/ hightlightin
[14:23] <peanutduck> Same
[14:23] <BhaveshSGupta> it is selecting/highlighting
[14:23] <sayan> now, while it is highlighted, you can yank it (which means copy)
[14:23] <sayan> press `y` to yank
[14:24] <sayan> to paste you can press `p` to paste
[14:25] <sahilister[m]> Done.
[14:25] <snowmanstark> done
[14:25] <sayan> did it work as intended?
[14:25] <snowmanstark> yes
[14:25] <apsychogirl[m]> done
[14:25] <sahilister[m]> Yes.
[14:26] <sayan> now you would notice since we use `p` it pasted it after the cursor, if you want paste it before the cursor use `P` (which is capital P)
[14:28] <sayan> next, to cut instead of copy, you use `d`
[14:28] <sayan> and similarly, `p` would paste it
[14:29] <sayan> raise your hands anytime if you have questions
[14:29] <sayan> or if I should go slow
[14:30] <peanutduck> !
[14:31] <sayan> Next, if you want to select a line of text, you do `V`, and that should select the whole line
[14:31] <sayan> nnext
[14:31] <sayan> next
[14:32] <peanutduck> How can I paste the paragraph with a space included? https://paste.centos.org/view/bde8aa1e
[14:34] <sayan> I'm not sure you can do that
[14:34] <peanutduck> Ok thanks sayan
[14:34] <sayan> You can either, yank a space, or do `o` or `O`
[14:35] <sayan> to enter a new line, but that actually adds a newline and goes into insert mode.
[14:36] <sayan> I've seen people do, one thing that is have a keymap that would be combining `o|O` and `Esc`
[14:36] <sayan> any other questions?
[14:36] <sahilister[m]> No.
[14:37] <sayan> Now to select a block of text you can use, Ctrl+v and use h,j,k,l
[14:38] <sayan> You can do something like Ctrl+v4j8l
[14:38] <sayan> raise your hands to tell what will, ggVG annd Vgg would do?
[14:39] <siddharthvipul> !
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:40] <siddharthvipul> more like answer to what sayan asked :)
[14:40] <snowmanstark> !
[14:40] <siddharthvipul> select whole file -> gg to go to top, V to select whole line, and G to go the end
[14:40] <siddharthvipul> for ggVg
[14:40] <sayan> next
[14:41] <siddharthvipul> s/ggVg/ggVG
[14:41] <BhaveshSGupta> Vgg
[14:41] <snowmanstark> Vgg would select from where you are to the start of the file
[14:42] <snowmanstark> including the line you are at
[14:42] <sayan> apsychogirl[m]: Anjika: darshna__ peanutduck are you following?
[14:42] <darshna__> yes
[14:42] <Anjika> Yes
[14:42] <apsychogirl[m]> yes
[14:42] <peanutduck> Yes
[14:43] <sayan> now, going on to bit of motion, you have `ip` and `ap`
[14:43] <sayan> ip means inner paragraph
[14:44] <sayan> ap means a paragrah
[14:44] <sayan> the latter includes a space, the former does not
[14:44] <sayan> tell me what happens with vap and vip
[14:45] <sahilister[m]> !
[14:45] <sayan> next
[14:45] <sahilister[m]> `vap` selects the whole paragraph.
[14:46] <sahilister[m]> `vip` is also doing the same, not sure i could grasp the difference.
[14:46] <snowmanstark> !!
[14:46] <apsychogirl[m]> vip unselects the last line.
[14:46] <apsychogirl[m]> not sure
[14:46] <BhaveshSGupta> !
[14:47] <sayan> sahilister[m]: check if vip selects the space after the paragraph?
[14:47] <sayan> with the output of vap
[14:47] <snowmanstark> the cursor goes to the line after the paragraph with `vap`
[14:47] <sayan> snowmanstark: yes
[14:47] <sayan> next
[14:48] <BhaveshSGupta> sayan, same as you said
[14:48] <sahilister[m]> sayan: Got it, thanks.
[14:49] <sayan> others?
[14:49] <apsychogirl[m]> <snowmanstark "the cursor goes to the line afte"> similar
[14:49] <sayan> Now, go to any place preferably middle of a line
[14:50] <sayan> Press Ctrl+v
[14:50] <sayan> press 5j to select couple of lines below it
[14:50] <sayan> then press `I`
[14:51] <sayan> type random text and press Esc
[14:51] <sayan> What happens?
[14:51] <peanutduck> Sorcery
[14:51] <sayan> haha!
[14:52] <snowmanstark> !
[14:52] <sahilister[m]> Half of lines vanished.
[14:52] <sayan> it should replicate the text, to all the selected column
[14:52] <sayan> next
[14:52] <darshna__> it selects the first alphabets
[14:53] <snowmanstark> Inserts the text to the selected lines at the initial cursor position
[14:54] <sayan> snowmanstark: yes
[14:55] <sayan> it should be like adding the same text to multiple lines
[14:56] <sayan> https://tmate.io/t/d5mXWNfSeuCCsVmLr73Smb5BT -- i created a tmate session to demo
[14:57] <snowmanstark> sayan: the session is closed perhaps
[14:57] <siddharthvipul> sayan: it says session closed
[14:57] <nabarun> sayan: did you exit the tmate session by accident?
[14:57] <sahilister[m]> sayan: `Session closed` is says
[14:58] <sayan> join this one: https://tmate.io/t/ro-yhck7NFfkpEeKqpmYTuyLD7vP
[14:59] <sahilister[m]> Yes, this is fine.
[14:59] <sayan> who all did not see?
[15:01] <sayan> everyone is in sync, or someone is still trying?
[15:01] <sahilister[m]> Done with the above tasks.
[15:01] <sayan> (would like to see some aye, or nay)
[15:01] <peanutduck> me sayan, i missed the tmate session
[15:02] <sayan> peanutduck: should I show again?
[15:02] <nabarun> aye
[15:02] <peanutduck> Yes please
[15:02] <sayan> peanutduck: showing in 5 seconds
[15:02] <peanutduck> Ol
[15:02] <peanutduck> Got it
[15:04] <sayan> If you replace `I` with `A` instead of adding the text after the cursor it does before
[15:05] <sayan> also, you can replace in visual mode with `r<replace_with_item>`
[15:06] <sayan> `ro` means replace selected item with `o`
[15:07] <sayan> next is, incase, you want to join multiple lines, you select the lines to join and use `J`
[15:09] <sayan> any questions?
[15:10] <snowmanstark> nope
[15:11] <sayan> A bunch of students have just vanished in thin air
[15:11] <sayan> really worried.
[15:11] <sahilister[m]> !
[15:11] <sayan> next
[15:11] <sahilister[m]> `r replace item` is not working
[15:12] <sayan> sahilister[m]: are you giving a space?
[15:12] <Anjika> !
[15:12] <apsychogirl[m]> <sayan "any questions?"> no
[15:12] <sayan> next
[15:12] <darshna__> !
[15:13] <snowmanstark> sahilister[m]: works for me
[15:13] <Anjika> r<replace_item> is used for single character?
[15:13] <sayan> *The Return of the Vanished Students*
[15:13] <sayan> next
[15:13] <sayan> Anjika: yes
[15:13] <Anjika> As multiple character is not working
[15:13] <darshna__> same problem as sahilister[m]
[15:13] <Anjika> Thanks sayan
[15:13] <BhaveshSGupta> sahilister,  select the the text and try ro
[15:14] <sahilister[m]> sayan: Got it.
[15:15] <sahilister[m]> BhaveshSGupta: Thanks, i was missing this part.
[15:16] <sayan> movign ahead
[15:16] <peanutduck> !
[15:16] <sayan> next
[15:16] <peanutduck> How can replace the selected word with just `o` instead of `oooooo`
[15:17] <snowmanstark> peanutduck: good question! I was going to ask after few tries
[15:18] <sayan> vco
[15:18] <sayan> :)
[15:19] <sayan> or Vco
[15:19] <peanutduck> snowmanstark, I did `cw` but just wondering if in visual mode it can be done
[15:19] <peanutduck> Oh, thanks sayan
[15:19] <sayan> download this file next: https://sayanchowdhury.fedorapeople.org/dgplug.c
[15:20] <sahilister[m]> Done.
[15:20] <sayan> select a couple of lines
[15:20] <sayan> and use '>' to ident.
[15:21] <sayan> '5>' ident 5 times
[15:21] <sayan> '<' unindent
[15:21] <sayan> '5<' unindent 5 times
[15:22] <sayan> select the whole file, and do `=` and let vim do the magic
[15:22] <sayan> after that tell me what would `vip=` would do?
[15:25] <peanutduck> !
[15:25] <snowmanstark> peanutduck: yes it would work
[15:25] <sayan> next
[15:25] <snowmanstark> !
[15:25] <sayan> next
[15:25] <peanutduck> sayan `vip=` doesn't do anything for me
[15:25] <sahilister[m]> peanutduck: +1
[15:26] <sayan> peanutduck: what do you think it should do?
[15:26] <snowmanstark> anything with `=` unintends
[15:26] <snowmanstark> so `vip=` just unintends the paragraph
[15:27] <sayan> = formats the selected part
[15:27] <snowmanstark> `ggVG=` will unintend the file
[15:27] <peanutduck> indents a paragraph
[15:27] <sayan> basically idents your code
[15:27] <sayan> if over indented then unident, or opposite
[15:27] <sayan> check tmate sessionn
[15:28] <sayan> will demo in 5 seconds
[15:28] <sayan> peanutduck: snowmanstark ^^
[15:28] <snowmanstark> sure
[15:28] <peanutduck> there sayan
[15:28] <snowmanstark> ready
[15:29] <sayan> first V=, then vip=
[15:29] <snowmanstark> That was awesome
[15:30] <sayan> sorry first was ggVG=
[15:30] <sayan> :)
[15:30] <sayan> vip as we did last time
[15:30] <sayan> select a paragraph
[15:30] <peanutduck> Ah ok now, I did `ggVG=` first then `vip=`, hence nothing happened
[15:30] <sayan> peanutduck: right
[15:30] <sayan> vip/vap we did before
[15:31] <sayan> vip/vap is to select the text, `=` formats
[15:31] <sahilister[m]> !
[15:31] <sayan> next
[15:32] <sahilister[m]> Essentially `w`, `q`, `vip` are shortforms of write, quit etc. right?
[15:32] <sahilister[m]> Everything in vim works like that way?
[15:32] <sayan> sahilister[m]: yes, I will share a talk
[15:32] <sayan> this is basically the vim language
[15:33] <sayan> iw means inner word
[15:33] <sayan> w means word
[15:33] <sayan> p means paragrah
[15:33] <sayan> ip means inner paragraph
[15:33] <sayan> ciw is change in word
[15:33] <sayan> cip is change in paragraph
[15:33] <sayan> so if you know the vim alphabets, you can speak the vim language
[15:34] <sahilister[m]> sayan: cool, thanks!
[15:34] <darshna__> oh
[15:34] <snowmanstark> sayan: that's interesting
[15:34] <sayan> Aye or Nay to move forward
[15:34] <snowmanstark> Aye
[15:34] <darshna__> aye
[15:34] <apsychogirl[m]> aye
[15:34] <peanutduck> Aye
[15:35] <Anjika> aye
[15:35] <sahilister[m]> *sahilister heavy session 😅
[15:35] <sayan> last part is changing case
[15:35] <sayan> ~ inverts the case of selected part
[15:35] <daemon1024> Aye ( Tho I'm late I mostly followed till now 😅 )
[15:35] <sayan> u for smaller case, U for upper case
[15:36] <sayan> Sadly for Title case, you need to have a search & replace pattern, which I will skip for now
[15:37] <sayan> tell me when done, this is the last topic of the day.
[15:37] <snowmanstark> done
[15:37] <peanutduck> Done
[15:37] <Anjika> done
[15:37] <apsychogirl[m]> <sayan "tell me when done, this is the l"> done
